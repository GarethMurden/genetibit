# Development notes

## To do

- Features
	- Upgrade field
		- Population limits
	- Select critter from field to view info
		- Sell critters from field
	- Competitions
	- Device-to-device communication

- Fixes
	- Breeding sale performance
		- Use 1 ribbon & text for rank
		- Include heterozygosity %
	- Shouldn't be possible to breed a critter to itself
	- Cursors don't move to right on breeding screen after first selection
	- Price sticks after menu close
	- selecting the current screen from the menu leaves menu open
	- Opening menu within breeding result flow should not be allowed

## Notes on `rshell`

### Connect

As an alternative to Thonny, `rshell` can be used to flash the Pico from the terminal.

https://www.martinfitzpatrick.dev/using-micropython-raspberry-pico/

1. Connect the Pico & determine it's COM port (e.g. via Windows device manager)
2. Start rshell with `rshell`
3. Check if the board's auto-connected with `boards`
4. If not, connect with `connect serial COM<port>`

### Upload

`rshell` treats the Pico as a virtual folder, files can be copied to it like so:

`cp <source> /pyboard/<destination>`

Where `<source>` is a path on the PC and `<destination>` is on the Pico's filesystem.

Make sure the source `.py` file is pre-compiled into a `.mpy` before copying to save RAM:

`python -m mpy_cross <source>`

### Run

The `game.py` file runs as soon as it's imported so it can be triggered with the following steps:

1. Acces the pico with `repl`
2.  `import game` to run `game.py`

(`Ctrl`+`X` to quit)
